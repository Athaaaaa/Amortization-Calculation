# Amortization-Calculation
Amortization models are essential tools for understanding and managing loan repayments, helping both borrowers and lenders design effective plans. This program explores and implements five common amortization models—Italian, French, American, Geometric, and Lump-Sum. It introduces the basic principles of each model and simulates their repayment processes through code. The program allows users to select different models and visually compare key parameters such as balance, interest, and principal. In conclusion, it highlights the strengths and limitations of each model, suggesting that the choice should depend on the borrower’s financial situation and needs.
